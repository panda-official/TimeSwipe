# This module uses the following variables:
#
# dmitigr_librarian_lib - the library to find. It used as path suffix of include path.
# ${dmitigr_librarian_lib}_include_names - names of the headers to find
# ${dmitigr_librarian_lib}_release_library_names - names of the release libraries to find
# ${dmitigr_librarian_lib}_debug_library_names - names of the debug libraries to find
# ${dmitigr_librarian_lib}_include_path_suffixes - PATH_SUFFIXES of headers. By default - include.
# ${dmitigr_librarian_lib}_library_path_suffixes - PATH_SUFFIXES of libraries. By default - lib.
# ${dmitigr_librarian_lib}_include_paths - PATHS of headers. Empty by default.
# ${dmitigr_librarian_lib}_library_paths - PATHS of libraries. Empty by default.
# ${dmitigr_librarian_lib}_FIND_REQUIRED - true or false
# CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE - to determine the preferred library for suggestion to link.
#
# This module defines the following variables:
#
# ${dmitigr_librarian_lib}_INCLUDE_DIRS - include directories
# ${dmitigr_librarian_lib}_LIBRARIES - suggested libraries to link
# ${dmitigr_librarian_lib}_DEBUG_LIBRARIES - debug libraries to link
# ${dmitigr_librarian_lib}_RELEASE_LIBRARIES - release libraries to link
# ${dmitigr_librarian_lib}_FOUND - true if ${dmitigr_librarian_lib} either of debug or release libraries are found
# ${dmitigr_librarian_lib}_DEBUG_FOUND - true if ${dmitigr_librarian_lib} debug libraries are found
# ${dmitigr_librarian_lib}_RELEASE_FOUND - true if ${dmitigr_librarian_lib} release libraries are found

# The search engine will consider CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH, CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH,
# or CMAKE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_PATH, CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH.
